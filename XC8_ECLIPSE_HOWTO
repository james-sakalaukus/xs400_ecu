Getting the most out of Eclipse CDT:
  XC8 header files still uses outdated methods to set absolute addresses 
  for hardware registers.  The result is that eclipse cannot index them properly, and
  things like GODONE and LATCbits.LATC3 cannot be referenced or used without Eclipse throwing
  a syntax error.
  
  The pic18f46k80.h packaged with XC8 has been reworked so eclipse can index it properly.  This
  can be done for other headers of interest using a find/replace with the following regular
  expression:     
    search:         @ (0x[0-9a-fA-F]{3})
    replace:        __attribute__((address($1)))
